# Fire-Classification-on-Image-Dataset
In this projects we are find the the classification of fire. In this project their is used image dataset and use deep learning model.

Developed a Fire Classification model using transfer learning with VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNet architectures, achieving up to 99% training accuracy on wildfire satellite image datasets.

Demonstrated strong generalization with 97.99% testing accuracy on an unseen dataset, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world wildfire detection scenarios.
